Capabilities at a Glance
------------------------

The main features of Protomix include:

- *Group Delay Removal:* Automatically removes group delay artifacts from your NMR data, ensuring cleaner spectra.
- *Solvent Residuals Removal:* Identifies and removes residual solvent peaks that can interfere with analysis.
- *Apodization:* Applies various apodization functions to your data to enhance signal-to-noise ratio.
- *Zero Filling:* Increases the number of data points through zero filling, which improves the resolution of the Fourier Transform.
- *Fourier Transform:* Converts time-domain NMR data into frequency-domain spectra, a key step in NMR data processing.
- *Phase Correction:* Corrects phase errors in the spectra to align peaks properly.
- *Internal Referencing:* Aligns chemical shifts in your spectra to a known reference peak, ensuring consistency across samples.
- *Baseline Correction:* Removes baseline drifts and inconsistencies in NMR spectra, providing a smoother baseline.
- *Negative Values Zeroing:* Sets negative intensities in spectra to zero, which is particularly useful for clean peak detection.
- *Region Removal:* Excludes specific spectral regions that are not of interest or may contain artifacts.
- *Window Selection:* Focuses analysis on selected regions of the spectra, enhancing targeted data analysis.
- *Peak Alignment:* Aligns peaks across multiple spectra for comparative analysis, crucial in metabolomics studies.
- *Binning:* Segments spectra into bins for statistical analysis, a common step in metabolomics data processing.
- *Normalization:* Normalizes spectra to account for concentration differences, ensuring comparability across samples.
