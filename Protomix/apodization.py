    Apply an apodization function to each Free Induction Decay (FID) row in a DataFrame.

    Apodization, in the context of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, is a windowing technique applied 
    to FID signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and improve line shape in the frequency domain. 
    This function supports two types of apodization: Gaussian and Exponential.

    :param fid_df: A DataFrame where each row represents an FID signal, and columns represent time points.
    :type fid_df: pd.DataFrame
    :param LB: Line broadening parameter, which determines the width of the apodization function. 
               A higher value results in more broadening. Defaults to 1.
    :type LB: float, optional
    :param apodization_type: Type of apodization function to apply. Options are 'gaussian' for Gaussian apodization, 
                             and 'exponential' for Exponential apodization. Defaults to 'gaussian'.
    :type apodization_type: str, optional
    
    :return: A DataFrame of the same shape as `fid_df`, containing the apodized FID values. Each FID row in the input 
             DataFrame is multiplied by the apodization function, transforming the data in the time domain.
